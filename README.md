# Socket-Programming : SimpleFTP
Two way communication between client and a server that supports multiple simultaneous clients, written in C++.  
The development in done in phases, from unilateral single connection to simultaneous clients and bilateral exchanges.  
A simple file transfer protocol using TCP sockets, with bandwidth limiting (still pretty fast though).
